# Union and Intersection
This Python code solves example 1.3 in chapter 1 (RELATION AND FUNCTIONS) in 10th mathematics.

## How it works

Guys, let me explain to you how Python code works.  
First you run the code it asks you to ```Enter the value of A``` enter a number or a list of numbers with a semicolon. At this time I enter the value of a as ```3``` and press ```enter```.

</p>

Then it again asks for the value of ```B```. This time I enter a list of numbers with a semicolon and then press ```enter```.

</p>

Again it asks value for c, then I enter the value of ```C``` as ```9```

</p>
                                                                                                                               
**Boom!**  
It assigns values to the variables ```A```, ```B```, ```C```
and it shows two default conditions of the original sum also some choices.
You have to run the first condition and check whether that condition is true or false by gradually implementing it, press ```i``` and press ```enter```.

  <img src = "https://github.com/sanbinary/Union-and-Intersection/blob/main/png/Screenshot%206.png?raw=true" alt"Screenshot%206"/>
</p>

It shows the solution to that condition or you can find the solution of the second condition by pressing ```ii```.

</p>

**It is not over!**  
You type ```cv``` and ```enter```. 
<p align="left">
  <img src = "https://github.com/sanbinary/Union-and-Intersection/blob/main/png/Screenshot%2010.png?raw=true" alt"Screenshot%2010"/>
</p>

It offers three variables with options. Press ```a``` or ```b``` or ```c``` to change the variable value. In this demo I have to change the value of ```B``` variable, so I press ```b``` and press ```enter```.
<p align="left">
  <img src = "https://github.com/sanbinary/Union-and-Intersection/blob/main/png/Screenshot%2012.png?raw=true" alt"Screenshot%2012"/>
</p>

it asks for the value of ```B``` variable I enter ```6``` and then press ```enter```.
<p align="left">
  <img src = "https://github.com/sanbinary/Union-and-Intersection/blob/main/png/Screenshot%2013.png?raw=true" alt"Screenshot%2013"/>
</p>

This changes the value of the variable ```B``` to ```6```.  
When you are done, press ```e``` and press ```enter```
